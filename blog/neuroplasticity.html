      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
      <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</li>
        <p>Before talking about the neuroplasticity, let’s see a picture first.</p>
        <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/466be6_509332ca36ee46f480afa38ee8974967~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_1480,al_c,q_95,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/466be6_509332ca36ee46f480afa38ee8974967~mv2.png" alt="Neuroplasticity" width="70%"></img><br>
        <p>To make it simple, it is about brain can change and brain do change throughout life.  This conclusion has such a far-reaching influences and affect every aspect of people’s life.</p>
        <p>According to the research published by Kleim & Jones, there are 10 principles of neuroplasticity. We can see from the pictures below:</p>
        <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/466be6_d767f5199b224d4397d5acc99169fc2d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_2288,al_c,q_95,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/466be6_d767f5199b224d4397d5acc99169fc2d~mv2.png" alt="principles" width="70%"></img>
        <p>I will take couple of these principles as an example to explain how it benefits people. Use it or Lose it & Use it and improve it: learning things is like building connections between your brain and things you are learning. When you using it, you are building the connection. The more you practice, stronger the connection would be. During practising, you are actually optimise  what you are doing which will improve it .  But if you stop using it for a while, the connection will become more weak until disappear.  These benefit people as people would be more motivated when they believe practice makes perfect. If they believe their ability is unchangeable, they won’t make any efforts.
        </p>


        <li>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</li>
        <p>I would adopt the two principles: repetition and intensity. Based on research results, repetition of learned behaviour is required for long-term changes in the brain. You need thousands of repetitions to master a skill. I will spend more time practicing when I start to learn some new skills for better understanding and performance.<br>
        And for ‘Intensity’, it doesn’t make much difference if I spent time doing something  doesn’t challenge me. Sometimes, I may feel stuck or struggled a lot when learning. While it means that I’m challenge my brain as well. The proper intensity is important so I will try to find an intensity that is one step above my current level.</p>
        <li>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</li>
        <p>
          There’re many ways to increase the neuroplasticity. I will list some below based on my research results and understanding:
          <br>Doing some problem-solving activities and learn some problem-solving strategies.
          <br>Playing video games. The benefits associated with gaming include improvements in: motor coordination, visual recognition and spatial navigation,  memory and reaction time,  reasoning, decision making, and problem-solving skills, resilience, cooperation and team participation.<br>Doing some creative activities, such as making arts, marking music.Creating art can help you see the world in new, unique ways. You might use art to sort through and express emotions, share personal experiences, or get deeper insight on personal struggles.
          <br>Doing exercise.Most people recognize that exercise offers a number of physical benefits. But physical activity also strengthens your brain. Exercise — aerobic exercise in particular — can lead to improvements in cognitive abilities like learning and memory.

      <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</li>
        <p>Growth mindset is first studied by Carol Dweck and her teams.After studying the behavior of thousands of children, Dr. Dweck coined the terms fixed mindset and growth mindset to describe the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence. When students believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger. Therefore they put in extra time and effort, and that leads to higher achievement.<br>
        It is also related with the Neuroplasticity.These neuroscientific discoveries have shown us that we can increase our neural growth by the actions we take, such as using good strategies, asking questions, practicing, and following good nutrition and sleep habits. if you believe your brain can grow, you behave differently.This can affect your attitude towards learning and if you are willing to put more efforts on, making more practice, there’s more chance that you can have more achievements. </p>

        <li>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
        <p>I got inspired by The Power of … Yet after I watched the TED talk by Dweck where she describes “two ways to think about a problem that’s slightly too hard for you to solve.” People approach these problems with the two mindsets… “Are you not smart enough to solve it …. or have you just not solved it yet.In the past, sometimes I feel afraid to try some challenges especially for those things that totally new for me as I don’t like the feeling “I’m not smart for it”. While after knowing the growth mindset and the power of yet, I understand that it is not I’m not smart to solve it , it is I’m not reach that level yet but if I make efforts, do continuous practice, I will reach that stage in the near future. </p>
        <li>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
        <p>I will stop thinking like that “I’m not smart enough; It’s too hard for me.” I will change my thinking to something like “I understand that it may be a bit challenging for me but I will grow my ability to achieve.” For practice aspects, I will use break the tasks into small tasks which is slightly higher than my current level so I can learn it step by step. And I will code everyday as practice makes perfect. </p>

      <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</li>
        <p>Learning Neuroplasticity shows me the importance of repetition. Practice makes perfect. For my learning strategy, I will practice the skills I have learnt in a daily basis. This will strengthen the connections of these skills in my mind. <br>
        The other thing is about the intensity. I understand sometimes I may feel struggled or frustrated when I got stuck in some challenges. But these learning materials which are slightly higher than my current learning level is actually the most efficient ones for the growth of brain. </p>
