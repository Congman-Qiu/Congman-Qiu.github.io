      <h1>Core Reflections</h1>
      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>I prefer to give things a really good go but sometimes will stuck for too long</li>
          <li>I have my own studying and working pace, but also like to work with others</li>
          <li>I'm not so confident about myself and it's improving.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>We all have different values, ideas and beliefs based on our own background, life experience. Self-awareness, empathy and values help us to embrace the differnece, respect others and work collaborately.</p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>It's actually more useful and helpful than I thought. I found the listening and looping part is quite challenging for me as English is not my first language. While I found after several practices,I felt more confident in expressing my ideas and better connecting with other classmates.</p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>A lot of reading and writting lol And listening(conscious listening and looping).</p>
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>Because core skills are as important as tech skills in the workplace.  And Dev Academy hope its graduates can work collaborately with others in their future career. </p>
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h2>
      <p>Not at all. There're so many topics I find them interesting and inspire me during my learning of foundations. </p>
