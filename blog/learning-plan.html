    <h1> My Learning Plan
    <body>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>My long term goal is to be a senior front-end developer. So the pathway I planned for myself is to find an entry IT job after completing the course from Dev Academy; Collecting the working experience and enhance my IT knowledge and skills during working; Attending more courses and personal developments when needed and gradually becoming a senior front-end developer. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
          <p>There’re several strengths of me when it comes to learning. Firstly, I’m curious to knowledge and eager to learn something new. Secondly, I have good planning skills and researching skills which would do some help in learning. Thirdly, I have good resilience which means that I won’t quit easily  when I meet difficulties and I will try a lot  to overcome the difficulties. Limitations of learning at this stage is that I don’t have much background knowledge in this area so I need to make more efforts to reduce this gap. </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          <p>The most important human skill I would like to develop in my studying at Dev Academy is to think like a programmer. I would like to build a computational think and the ability to breakdown a big or complicate task or question into small pieces which I can sort the way out with my current knowledge and skills. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. <br>This should include:
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
            <p>Working as a team, I will make a plan together with the team members and contributes my ideas and suggestions. Once the plan made, I will respect the team plan and complete my personal task on time.  I may ask help if I’m stuck and I will also help others if it’s something I can help. Once the task done, I will do reflections of this team work which may do some help for the next one. If things are building up and starting to get to me, I will firstly analyse the situation to make a better action plan with time tracking. If I found that it’s actually above my ability, I will explain this situation to my team to see whether we could work it out together. </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
          <p>I won’t be afraid of sharing the problems or confusions I meet in this learning journey. I will try to figure out the answer myself by reviewing the course content and do some research first with a time limits. If I couldn’t find the answer in this time, I will post the questions on the channel on Discord, the #tech-questions, #foundations or Homegroup chats to ask for helps. And move on to the next part so I can manage the whole study content in a reasonable time range. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          <p>I hope that when I have some tech questions, there’re some experienced and skilled facilitation team who are able to answer my questions. And they can share some tips of learning based on their personal experience in this field. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
          <p>As I live alone in Auckland  there’s no whanau commitments. I have a regular habit of workout and I think it will help my learning.</p>
