      <h1>Problem-solving</h1>
      <h2>A time I was stuck</h2>
      <p>I was stuck on a problem during the last sprint about manipulating the DOM, the game board one. It’s about to write a code in JS and The Document Object Model to create a game board with dots in different colours with different action. I successfully linked the ‘click’ action with the function ‘turn blue’ and the ‘context menu’ with the function ‘turn green’. Then I got stuck with the ‘doubleclick’ with the function ‘hide’ which makes the dots into while colour. I felt that I wrote the correct code but it couldn’t do the function I expected. I felt quite frustrated as I spent extra two hours to figure out what’s the real issues is. Finally I solved this problem out with the problem-solving techniques Rubber ducky method and reviews the code I wrote lines by lines. Finally I figured out the problem is I wrote the words ‘dblclick’ wrongly into ‘dbclick’. It was such a silly spelling mistake but made me really stuck at that time. Things I learnt is that I need to more conscious about the small mistakes.

      <h2>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p>A time I elegantly solved a problem was when I doing the Super FizzBuzz challenges. I felt this tasks is a bit complicated  so I use Pseucode to breakdown into small steps. When it came to some syntax I was not familiar with, I used google to find the right way to use it. Then I wrote the code steps by steps and I realised that it is not that hard as I’m imaging. I felt much more confident after I successfully made it by using some problem-solving skills. </p>
      <h2> Reflecting on Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>I will use the Pseudocode when I try to solve some complicated tasks. I would breakdown the probelm into small steps which I can figure out a way to reach a expected outcome. Then steps by steps, I will move through to the final goal I want to achieve. It is really useful.</p>
      <h3>Trying something</h3>
      <p>I find that the process of writing codes is trying something. Because for me, I feelt it is really hard to write a clear and functional code at one time. I need to make changes, try soem different ways and make a lot of adjustments to meet the expected outcome.</p>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>I mentioned a situation I used rubber ducky methoding to solve a problem in the previous example. And I felt this method is good to check mistakes. By reviewing it lines by lines, it will be easier to find out where the mistakes lies. </p>
      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>I learnt this techniques after I learnt something about testing in this sprint. I understood the structure of test code, the messages and the expected output. By reading error messages, I get a clear understanding about what the mistake is and how could I avoid it.</p>
      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
      <p>I used this a lot for JS file. I would link it with a html file so I can use Cosole.logging to check what the outcome of the code I write. Now I know I can use 'node' in the terminal to have the same function as console.logging.</p>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>I use google a lot and after this section, I leanrt to how to google it to find the useful information. The format is like JS(the name of the code language), how could I add property into an array of object(the function I want to achieve). I can get a lot of examples and information in a fastest ways.</p>
      <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p>I shared the problems I met on the channels of Discord and there're many nice classmates who are willing to share their experiences and ideas with me. </p>
      <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p>Faciliators form Dev academy is really nice and helpful. They help me a lot with the situations I got stuck with some tech questions.</p>
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p>That's what I'm doing during the whole process of studying at boot camp so far. I did reflections at weekly basis and adjusted strategies I would like to use for the next week studying.</p>
