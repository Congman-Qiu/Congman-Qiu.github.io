          <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
          <p>A ethical decision I have made dated back to my college time. Before the deadline of one assignment, my friend asked me to borrow my assignment as she said she had trouble with it and it was close to deadline. Although I’m a person who value friendship much, I feel it is more important to distinguish right from wrong. Instead of showing her my own essay, I shared some learning materials with her and help her to organise the framework of this essay. I believe I did the right thing as I think everyone should be honest to themselves, respect the originality and make their own efforts.  </p>

          <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
          <p>I have been New Zealand for over five years now and I’m originally from China. The Chinese culture has influenced me a lot as I grow up in that cultural background. I love my cultural identity and I believe that there’re many values and believes are valuable treasures, such as respecting parents, treating the elder and the younger of others just like treating those in your own family. </p>

          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          <p>I hope that when I have some tech questions, there’re some experienced and skilled facilitation team who are able to answer my questions. And they can share some tips of learning based on their personal experience in this field. </p>

          <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
          <p>My strengths:<br>
            1.Curious about the world: I’m always curious about the surroundings, the new things. So I’m always being prepared to learn something new and I’m not afraid of challenge. <br>
            2.Kindness: I believe I’m a nice and kind person and will always respect others. I believe this personality would help me to work better as a team as I would value others’s strengths and believes.<br>
            3. Good research skills: I like problem-solving via researching all the materials and resources I could gain via internet, books, experienced others, which would absolutely benefits me in my learning.

          <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
          <p>I think the biggest limitation of me is that sometime I overthink before taking the action. I would worried too much and wish this plan is a perfect plan before taking the action. But overtimes, I realised that shortcoming and I tried to encourage myself to have a try first as there will never be a perfect plan. I can always adjust it when taking actions. Reflections after it is a good way to adjust the plan so just have a go first. </p>

          <h2>
            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I worked as a ECE teacher in one centre, I had different option against with one colleagues  in my team about how to provide an inviting environment for children. The strategy I use is to have an honest and open conversation with that colleagues and tried to find a common believe we all agree with. As we all want the same outcome which is do the most benefit for children, the only thing we need to adjust is the method to reach this outcome. After that conversion, we worked in a more efficient way and understand each other better.
